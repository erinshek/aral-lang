# Get Started

## Install Aral

Currently, the Aral programming language is in the development stage. 
Therefore, it is not yet possible to install and test it. However, 
the project is progressing rapidly. As a result, in the near future, 
you will be able to install an interpreter and see the results of the code you have written.

## Quickstart

The code writing syntax of the Aral programming language is as simple as Python's. 
You can see this in the example of the "Hello World" code below.

```aral
shıǵar("Hello World");
```

## Syntax

The syntax of the Aral programming language is in Karakalpak. 
All keywords and commands are written using words from the Karakalpak language.

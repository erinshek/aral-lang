# Data Types

As the programming language is still in the development stage, not all data types have been created yet. 
Currently, you can use `number` and `string` types. At present, it is possible to create variables of the number type.

## Example

```aral
ózgeriwshi san a = 5;
ózgeriwshi san b = 3;

shıǵar(a + b);
```

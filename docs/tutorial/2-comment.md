# Creating a Comment

In the Aral programming language, comments are written using the `//` symbol, 
similar to C++ and Java. For multi-line comments, you can use `/* */`.

## Example

```aral
// this is a comment
shıǵar("Hello World");
```

```aral
/*
    this is a 
    multi-line 
    comment     
*/
shıǵar("Hello World");
```

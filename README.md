## What is Aral?

**Aral** is an *interpretive experimental programming language* developed in Java.  
It is designed primarily for **learning**, **research**, and **hobbyist exploration** of language design and compiler theory.

The project is **open-source**, and contributions or collaborations from curious minds are warmly welcomed.

    shıǵar("b is greater than a");
} dım bolmasa {
    shıǵar("a and b are equal");
}
```

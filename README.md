## What is Aral?

**Aral** is an *interpretive experimental programming language* developed in Java.  
It is designed primarily for **learning**, **research**, and **hobbyist exploration** of language design and compiler theory.

The project is **open-source**, and contributions or collaborations from curious minds are warmly welcomed.

## Example

```aral
ózgeriwshi san a = 5;
ózgeriwshi san b = 3;

eger (a > b) bolsa {
    shıǵar("a is greater than b");
} ol bolmasa (b > a) {
    shıǵar("b is greater than a");
} dım bolmasa {
    shıǵar("a and b are equal");
}
```

## Installation

Aral is still in its early development stage and is not yet ready for general use.
However, public builds and usage guides will be available soon — stay tuned!
